How to Build a Dropbox-like Sharing App using Ruby on Rails
By: Phyo Wai

Tutorial found on:http://http://codyaray.com/downloads/2012/03/How-to-Build-a-Dropbox-like-Sharing-App-using-Ruby-on-Rails.html 

The tutorial assumes the following applications are installed
Ruby 1.9.+
Rails 3+
MySQL 5+

MySQL 5+ not installed on current machine, installed it through:
  sudo apt-get install mysql-server
Entered the following login information:
  username: root
  password: admin

Notes during tutorial:

STEP 1:

Instructions to add "gem 'ruby-mysql'" to Gemfile, however couldn't get database to work with this gem. Error message when executing rake db:create:
  Please install the mysql adapter: `gem install activerecord-mysql-adapter` 
Problem should be solved by running:
gem install activerecord-mysql-adapter
However getting error message :
ERROR:  Could not find a valid gem 'activerecord-mysql-adapter' (>= 0) in any repository

Decided to use mysql2 as a replacement Sql server (this one is listed as default in the Gemfile)

Needed to run the following commmands to get mysql2 installed:
1. sudo apt-get install libmysql-ruby libmysqlclient-dev
2. gem install mysql2

Modifying database.yml:
Socket location for mysql was incorrect. Used the following command to find the right location:
  mysqladmin variables | grep socket
This gave the following output: /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock
Replaced socket: /tmp/mysql.sock with:
  socket:  /var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock

Also changed the following lines:
  adapter: mysql2
  password: admin

PART 2:

After installing devise the following information is given for changes that need to be added manually:

===============================================================================

Some setup you must do manually if you haven't yet:

  1. Ensure you have defined default url options in your environments files. Here 
     is an example of default_url_options appropriate for a development environment 
     in config/environments/development.rb:

       config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { :host => 'localhost:3000' }

     In production, :host should be set to the actual host of your application.

  2. Ensure you have defined root_url to *something* in your config/routes.rb.
     For example:

       root :to => "home#index"

CAN BE SKIPPED! This is done by nifty generator in our case
  3. Ensure you have flash messages in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.
     For example:

       <p class="notice"><%= notice %></p>
       <p class="alert"><%= alert %></p>

IS SKIPPED FOR NOW
  4. If you are deploying Rails 3.1 on Heroku, you may want to set:

       config.assets.initialize_on_precompile = false

     On config/application.rb forcing your application to not access the DB
     or load models when precompiling your assets.

===============================================================================
The command for the following step is missing:
	Now, let's create our first model, User, using "devise".
Use this command:
	rails generate devise User

# Info found on https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#getting-started
# General command: rails generate devise MODEL

Instead of running the modified ..._devise_create_user.rb file as specified by the tutorial decided to run the migration file created by devise. Only added the following line just before t.timestamps:
	t.string :name

  Added the following lines in "app/views/devise/registrations/new.html.erb" (slightly different from the tutorial lines)
    <div><%= f.label :name %><br />  
  <%= f.text_field :name %></div>

  users/sign_out/ didn't work replaced the following line in config/routes.rb
    devise_for :users
  replaced with:
    devise_for :users do get '/users/sign_out' => 'devise/sessions#destroy' end

  STEP 3 Add Basic CSS
  
  Added CSS information not in "public/stylesheets/application.css" but in newly created file:
   app/assets/stylesheets/custom.css

  STEP 4 Uploading files

  After adding gem "paperclip", "~> 2.3" in gemfile had to run bundle install twice. After the first bundle install the following line was generated during output:
     gemfile  mocha

First tried to run rake db:migrate but got the following error:
  Could not find gem 'mocha (>= 0) ruby' in the gems available on this machine.
  Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.

Ran bundle install again and the migrations worked.

In the migration file add the following line:
  add_index :assets, :user_id  
As follows:
  def self.up
    create_table :assets do |t|
      t.integer :user_id
      t.timestamps
    end
    add_index :assets, :user_id
  end

  Flash messages are not working and Destroy action is not working. Decided to continue with S3 integrations first.
  
  STEP 5 Integrate Amazon S3

  Installed gem 'aws-sdk', '~> 1.3.4' next to 'gem-aws' cause file uploading wasn't working. Not sure if the problem was with the gem, more likely the login information was causing problems. Decided to stick with the new gem cause it is also adviced by Paperclip

  Modified the following line for the S3 credentials:
    :s3_credentials => "#{Rails_ROOT}/config/amazon_s3.yml", 
  Method #{Rails_ROOT} is deprecated used the following command instead:
    :s3_credentials => ::Rails.root.join('config/amazon_s3.yml'),

  Created the amazon_s3.yml with the correct information and added the file to .gitignore to prevent exposing information to other people

  Received error message caused by the following line:
      data = open(URI.parse(URI.encode(asset.uploaded_file.url)))  
  Solved it by add the following in the top of the assets_controller.rb file:
      require 'open-uri'
